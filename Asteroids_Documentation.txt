Assignment:
ASTEROIDS

Description:
This project is a recreation of the classic vector-drawn arcade game "ASTEROIDS" in Unity.

User Responsibilites:
The user's goal is to destroy asteroids while avoiding any contact between their ship and the asteroids. Points are awarded for every asteroid destroyed.

'W' accelerates the ship forward.
'S' accelerates the ship backwards.
'A' rotates the ship counter-clockwise.
'D' rotates the ship clockwise.

Above and Beyond:
-I drew all the prefab assets (ship, asteroids, bullet) myself in Adobe Illustrator.
-I spent a lot of time trying to add elastic collisions between asteroids. I was not successful in getting it to work; when the collision occurs, the elastic collision method gets called constantly, resulting in the asteroids sticking together since their velocities are being recalculated every frame. I was not able to resolve the logic to get this to work without any use of Unity's built-in collision methods, but the math is there and I believe it is all accurate.
-I set up the asteroid spawning so that the first asteroids spawned in are spawned in a range of the screen that excludes the center, preventing any of the initial asteroids from spawning on the player.
-I added temporary invulnerability after the player gets hit, along with a visual indicator on the ship.
-I know it's not much, but I also added a Game Over text that appears when the player's lives are depleted.

Known Issues:
 -The collision methods function as expected, but required some unexpected operations to calculate correctly.
 -The GUI method draws a 0 on top of the first digit for unknown reasons.

Sources:
-All prefab assets were created by me in Adobe Illustrator.

Notes:
I would like to use my grace period on this project to soften my penalty.
